        <h4>Pilot</h4>
        <p>
          In her childhood, Rue Bennett struggled with a number of issues (among
          them mental disorders and her father's death from cancer), which led
          to drug addiction in her teens. Now 17, Rue returns home from rehab
          and immediately buys drugs from her friend and drug dealer Fezco
          ("Fez"). Jules Vaughn, a transgender girl who is new in town, is
          invited by Kat Hernandez, a classmate, to a party hosted by popular
          college freshman Christopher McKay. Jules decides to first meet up at
          a motel with an older man from a hookup app. She lies about her age
          and they have sex. At the party, Kat loses her virginity. McKay and
          his girlfriend Cassie Howard have an uncomfortable sexual encounter,
          but discuss it tenderly. Maddy Perez, who recently broke up with star
          quarterback Nate Jacobs, has public revenge sex with a partygoer named
          Tyler. Angered by this, Nate drunkenly harasses Jules, who threatens
          Nate with a knife before cutting herself. Jules leaves the party,
          accompanied by Rue, who introduces herself and goes home with her. As
          Nate returns home, he encounters his father, Cal, who was Jules's
          hookup.

        <h4>"Stuntin' Like My Daddy"</h4>
        <p>
          At 11, Nate discovers his father's collection of homemade videos
          featuring him having sex with young gay men and transgender women.
          Upon entering high school, Nate becomes a successful quarterback who
          struggles with anger issues and sexual insecurities. In the present,
          Nate breaks into Tyler's house and severely beats him, accusing him of
          raping Maddy at McKay's party after Maddy falsely tells him she
          blacked out. On the first day of school, Rue breaks down after being
          asked to talk about her summer. Cassie's sister Lexi attempts to
          comfort her, but Rue lashes out at her. Rue reminisces about trying
          oxycodone for the first time at 13, stealing from her father's
          prescription. Kat discovers that a video of her having sex at McKay's
          party is circulating online and realizes she can make money as a
          camgirl. Jules starts messaging with an anonymous male high school
          student. McKay spends time with Cassie and accuses her of being too
          sexually forward. Mouse, Fezco's intimidating supplier, coerces Rue
          into trying fentanyl. It is revealed that the man Jules is texting is
          Nate, using the name "Tyler".

          A young Kat abruptly gains weight on a family vacation. Her
          middle-school boyfriend, Daniel, breaks up with her. She retreats into
          the world of romance and becomes a popular online fan fiction writer.
          In the present, Kat starts to work as a camgirl, catering to a series

          she will not remain friends with her if she keeps using drugs. At her
          Narcotics Anonymous meeting, Rue says she is 60 days sober; another
          attendee, Ali, tells her he knows she is lying. Rue helps Jules take
          nude photos of herself after Nate sends her a dick pic. Rue steals
          pills from Jules's kitchen. Maddy is shocked to find dick pics on
          Nate's phone. Rue and Jules argue after Jules reveals her plans to
          meet "Tyler" alone at night. Shortly thereafter, Rue goes to Jules's
          house to apologize and ends up kissing her. Panicked at the thought of
          alienating Jules, Rue visits Fez to get drugs, but, afraid for her
          well-being, he refuses to sell her any and locks her out of his house.
          Upset, Rue blames Fez for her addiction. She calls Ali for help.

          <li>
            Euphoria marks Schafer's first ever acting role. Prior to landing
            the role of Jules, her intentions were to go to London for fashion
            school.
          </li>
          <li>
            Schafer collaborated closely with Levison on creating Jules and her
            backstory.
          </li>
          <li>
            Regarding her sexuality, Schafer has stated that she is “closer to
            what people might call a lesbian”. More recently however, in
            December 2021, she stated that her sexuality was "bi or pan or
            something"
          </li>
          <li>
            Schafer received her first writing credit as a "co-writer" on the
